# A list of resources for brainstorm and getting ideas

1. [SfePy documentation](http://sfepy.org/doc-devel/index.html#documentation)

- SfePy is a python-based finite element solver and has quite similar procedure for importing mesh and running analysis. We can use their format for generating the Documentation and example files.

2. [Onscale software](https://onscale.com/features/)

- A multiphysics software for finite element analysis
- A good article on the advantages of running analysis on the server, 
considering computational software as well as storage [Why would you ever put your FEA in the cloud](http://feaforall.com/why-cloud-fea-and-how/)

3. [Finite element method as a service][https://medium.com/industrial-iota-lab-aachen-wzl-of-rwth-aachen/iila-x-iota-finite-element-method-as-a-service-2a782a479516]

- Another article about finite element solver on the cloud and connecting this to a internet of things framework for having a digital twin.

4. [Evalf computing](https://evalf.com/)

- They have a web-based interface for [Nutils](http://www.nutils.org/en/latest/tutorial/), another python-based finite element solver. But the description is pretty limited.
