# Composites on Clouds

Composites on Clouds (CoC) is a web-based open-source finite element tool for analysis of filling pattern and filling time of composite preforms in high-pressure RTM processes designed to address the second problem in [ASC challenge 2019](http://asc-student-challenge.appspot.com/). The web-framework is based on Django, a fast and versatile framework developed with Python. The finite element solver is developed using FEniCS, a next-generation computing platform for solving partial differential equations with high-level Python and C++ interfaces and high-performance and parallel-computing capabilities. The visualization utilizes open-source Python libraries and Paraview.

To start using CoC, please take a look at our [test cases and examples](https://github.com/shf/ASC_Challenge_2019/wiki/Tests-and-Examples).

To look at the code and develop your own models, take a look at our [installation page](https://github.com/shf/ASC_Challenge_2019/wiki/Installation)

If you like to know more about the theory behind the numerical model, read the [Theoretical Background](https://github.com/shf/ASC_Challenge_2019/wiki/Theoretical-Background). 

If you have any further questions, please contact use using nasser@composites.ubc.com or shayan@composites.ubc.com.

A quick demonstration of the software and solving method is available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjIqq_wp4B0)
